What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important? \\n“Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for \\nevery person in the world is impossible. While we can’t obtain a height measurement from everyone in the \\npopulation, we can still sample some people. The question now becomes, what can we say about the \\naverage height of the entire population given a single sample. The Central Limit Theorem addresses this \\nquestion exactly.” Read more here. \\n2. What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know? \\n“Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyze a representative \\nsubset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined.” Read the full \\nanswer here. \\n3. What is the difference between type I vs type II error? \\n“A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but is rejected. A type II error occurs when the null \\nhypothesis is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected.” Read the full answer here. \\n4. What is linear regression? What do the terms p-value, coefficient, and r-squared \\nvalue mean? What is the significance of each of these components? \\nA linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis: for example, the price of a house depends \\non a myriad of factors, such as its size or its location. In order to see the relationship between these \\nvariables, we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can \\nhelp conclude whether or not these two factors have a positive or negative relationship. Read \\nmore here and here. \\n5. What are the assumptions required for linear regression? \\nThere are four major assumptions: 1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and \\nthe regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 2. The errors or residuals of the \\ndata are normally distributed and independent from each other, 3. There is minimal multicollinearity \\nbetween explanatory variables, and 4. Homoscedasticity. This means the variance around the regression \\nline is the same for all values of the predictor variable. \\n \\n6. What is a statistical interaction? \\n”Basically, an interaction is when the effect of one factor (input variable) on the dependent variable (output \\nvariable) differs among levels of another factor.” Read more here. \\n7. What is selection bias? \\n“Selection (or ‘sampling’) bias occurs in an ‘active,’ sense when the sample data that is gathered and \\nprepared for modeling has characteristics that are not representative of the true, future population of cases'),\n",

Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non -random sample of a population causing some \\nmembers of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample. \\n2.

High p-value (≥ 0.05) indicates strength for the null hypothesis which means we can accept the \\nnull Hypothesis p-value of 0.05 indicates the Hypothesis could go either way. To put it in another way, \\n \\nHigh P values: your data are likely with a true null. Low P values: your data are unlikely with a true null. \\n \\nQ11. In any 15-minute interval, there is a 20% probability that you will see at least one shooting star. \\nWhat is the probability that you see at least one shooting star in the period of an hour? \\n \\nProbability of not seeing any shooting star in 15 minutes is \\n \\n= 1  – P( Seeing one shooting star ) \\n= 1 – 0.2  = 0.8       \\n \\nProbability of not seeing any shooting star in the period of one hour \\n \\n=  (0.8) ^ 4   =  0.4096 \\n \\nProbability of seeing at least one shooting star in the one hour \\n \\n= 1  – P( Not seeing any star ) \\n= 1 – 0.4096 = 0.5904      \\n \\nQ12. How can you generate a random number between 1 – 7 with only a die? \\n \\n• Any die has six sides from 1-6. There is no way to get seven equal outcomes from a single rolling of \\na die. If we roll the die twice and consider the event of two rolls, we now have 36 different outcomes. \\n• To get our 7 equal outcomes we have to reduce this 36 to a number divisible by 7. We can thus \\nconsider only 35 outcomes and exclude the other one. \\n• A simple scenario can be to exclude the combination (6,6), i.e., to roll the die again if 6 appears twice. \\n• All the remaining combinations from (1,1) till (6,5) can be divided into 7 parts of 5 each. This way all \\nthe seven sets of outcomes are equally likely. \\n \\nQ13. A certain couple tells you that they have two children, at least one of which is a girl. What is the \\nprobability that they have two girls? \\n \\nIn the case of two children, there are 4 equally likely possibilities \\n \\nBB, BG, GB and GG; \\n \\nwhere B = Boy and G = Girl and the first letter denotes the first child. \\n \\nFrom the question, we can exclude the first case of BB. Thus  from the remaining 3 possibilities \\nof BG, GB & BB, we have to find the probability of the case with two girls. \\n \\nThus, P(Having two girls given one girl)  =  1 / 3'),\n",

Python or R – Which one would you prefer for text analytics? \\n \\nWe will prefer Python because of the following reasons: \\n \\n• Python would be the best option because it has Pandas library that provides easy to use data \\nstructures and high-performance data analysis tools. \\n• R is more suitable for machine learning than just text analysis. \\n• Python performs faster for all types of text analytics. \\n \\nQ29. How does data cleaning plays a vital role in the analysis? \\n \\nData cleaning can help in analysis because: \\n \\n• Cleaning data from multiple sources helps to transform it into a format that data analysts or data \\nscientists can work with. \\n• Data Cleaning helps to increase the accuracy of the model in machine learning. \\n• It is a cumbersome process because as the number of data sources increases, the time taken to \\nclean the data increases exponentially due to the number of sources and the volume of data \\ngenerated by these sources. \\n• It might take up to 80% of the time for just cleaning data making it a critical part of the analysis task. \\n \\nQ30.

Sometimes \\nstar schemas involve several layers of summarization to recover information faster. \\n \\nQ32. What is Cluster Sampling? \\n \\nCluster sampling is a technique used when it becomes difficult to study the target population spread across \\na wide area and simple random sampling cannot be applied. Cluster Sample is a probability sample where \\neach sampling unit is a collection or cluster of elements. \\n \\nFor eg., A researcher wants to survey the academic performance of high school students in Japan. He can \\ndivide the entire population of Japan into different clusters (cities). Then the researcher selects a number of \\nclusters depending on his research through simple or systematic random sampling. \\n \\nLet’s continue our Data Science Interview Questions blog with some more statistics questions. \\n \\nQ33. What is Systematic Sampling? \\n \\nSystematic sampling is a statistical technique where elements are selected from an ordered sampling frame. \\nIn systematic sampling, the list is progressed in a circular manner so once you reach the end of the list, it is \\nprogressed from the top again. The best example of systematic sampling is equal probability method. \\n \\nQ34. What are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues? \\n \\nEigenvectors are used for understanding linear transformations. In data analysis, we usually calculate the \\neigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix. Eigenvectors are the directions along which a particular \\nlinear transformation acts by flipping, compressing or stretching. \\n \\nEigenvalue can be referred to as the strength of the transformation in the direction of eigenvector or the \\nfactor by which the compression occurs. \\n \\nQ35. Can you cite some examples where a false positive is important than a false negative? \\n \\nLet us first understand what false positives and false negatives are. \\n \\n• False Positives are the cases where you wrongly classified a non-event as an event a.k.a Type I \\nerror. \\n• False Negatives are the cases where you wrongly classify events as non-events, a.k.a Type II error. \\n \\nExample 1:  In the medical field, assume you have to give chemotherapy to patients. Assume a patient \\ncomes to that hospital and he is tested positive for cancer, based on the lab prediction but he actually doesn’t \\nhave cancer. This is a case of false positive. Here it is of utmost danger to start chemotherapy on this patient \\nwhen he actually does not have cancer. In the absence of cancerous cell, chemotherapy will do certain \\ndamage to his normal healthy cells and might lead to severe diseases, even cancer. \\n \\nExample 2: Let’s say an e-commerce company decided to give $1000 Gift voucher to the customers whom \\nthey assume to purchase at least $10,000 worth of items.

Can you cite some examples where both false positive and false negatives are equally \\nimportant? \\n \\nIn the Banking industry giving loans is the primary source of making money but at the same time if your \\nrepayment rate is not good you will not make any profit, rather you will risk huge losses. \\n \\nBanks don’t want to lose good customers and at the same point in time, they don’t want to acquire bad \\ncustomers. In this scenario, both the false positives and false negatives become very important to measure. \\n \\nQ38. Can you explain the difference between a Validation Set and a Test Set? \\n \\nA Validation set can be considered as a part of the training set as it is used for parameter selection and to \\navoid overfitting of the model being built. \\n \\nOn the other hand, a Test Set is used for testing or evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning \\nmodel. \\n \\nIn simple terms, the differences can be summarized as; training set is to fit the parameters i.e. weights and \\ntest set is to assess the performance of the model i.e. evaluating the predictive power and generalization. \\n \\nQ39. Explain cross-validation. \\n \\nCross-validation is a model validation technique for evaluating how the outcomes of statistical analysis \\nwill generalize to an independent dataset. Mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast and \\none wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice. \\n \\nThe goal of cross-validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase (i.e. validation data \\nset) in order to limit problems like overfitting and get an insight on how the model will generalize to an \\nindependent data set. \\n \\n \\n \\nMACHINE LEARNING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS \\nQ40.

After data preparation, start running the model, analyze the result and tweak the approach. This is an \\niterative step until the best possible outcome is achieved. \\n5. Validate the model using a new data set. \\n6. Start implementing the model and track the result to analyze the performance of the model over the \\nperiod of time. \\n \\nQ59. During analysis, how do you treat missing values? \\nThe extent of the missing values is identified after identifying the variables with missing values. If any \\npatterns are identified the analyst has to concentrate on them as it could lead to interesting and meaningful \\nbusiness insights. \\n \\nIf there are no patterns identified, then the missing values can be substituted with mean or median values \\n(imputation) or they can simply be ignored. Assigning a default value which can be mean, minimum or \\nmaximum value. Getting into the data is important. \\n \\nIf it is a categorical variable, the default value is assigned. The missing value is assigned a default value. If \\nyou have a distribution of data coming, for normal distribution give the mean value. \\n \\nIf 80% of the values for a variable are missing then you can answer that you would be dropping the variable \\ninstead of treating the missing values.'),\n",

How Are Weights Initialized in a Network? \\nThere are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly. \\n \\nInitializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer \\nperform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless. \\n \\nInitializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by initializing them very close to \\n0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most \\ncommonly used method. \\n \\nQ76. What Is the Cost Function? \\n \\nAlso referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measure to evaluate how good your model’s \\nperformance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error \\nbackwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions. \\n \\nQ77. What Are Hyperparameters? \\n \\nWith neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A \\nhyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a \\nnetwork is trained and the structure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, \\nepochs, etc.). \\n \\nQ78. What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set inaccurately (Too Low or Too High)? \\n \\nWhen your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal \\nupdates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point. \\n \\nIf the learning rate is set too high, this causes undesirable divergent behaviour to the loss function due to \\ndrastic updates in weights. It may fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is \\ntoo chaotic for the network to train). \\n \\nQ79. What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning? \\n• Epoch – Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model). \\n• Batch – Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we \\ndivide the dataset into several batches.'),\n",

These tokens are usually words that can also be phrases, punctuation marks, or even individual characters. Tokenization is the first step in NLP and is essential for text preprocessing. Tokenization helps in preparing the text data for analysis by making it more structured and easier to work with.There are different approaches to tokenization, such as rule-based and statistical-based methods. In the rule-based method, tokenization is done based on pre-defined rules such as white spaces, punctuation marks, and other grammatical structures. On the other hand, the statistical-based method uses machine learning techniques to learn from the data and identify the most appropriate tokenization approach.For instance, consider the following sentence: “I love NLP!” The rule-based tokenization would result in the following tokens: [“I”, “love”, “NLP”, “!”]. While the statistical-based approach would consider context and possibly tokenize the sentence as [“I”, “love”, “natural”, “language”, “processing”, “!”].Embedding turns mapping of the input text vector to the embedding matrix. embedding does a richer representation of the relationship between tokens ( can limit size + can be learned). Embedding, on the other hand, is the process of representing words or phrases as vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors are often referred to as embeddings. Embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the words or phrases and their relationships in the text. They are usually created using machine learning techniques such as Word2Vec or GloVe.Embeddings are powerful tools that help to improve the performance of NLP models. By representing words as vectors, embeddings enable the models to capture the context and meaning of the text. For example, consider the words “king,” “queen,” “man,” and “woman.” These words are related, and their relationships can be captured using embeddings. In an embedding space, the vector difference between “king” and “queen” would be similar to the vector difference between “man” and “woman.”----1FollowWritten by Geoffrey Rathinapandi72 followers·18 followingML Architect @IBM | Machine Learning Enthusiastic !!

However, their reliance on static,\\ninternal knowledge leads to notable limitations. At\\nthe simultaneously, this reliance easily leads to\\nhallucinations (Huang et al., 2025), so LLMs may\\nstruggle with open-ended tasks (Wang et al., 2025c;\\nTrivedi et al., 2022). Therefore, it is crucial to en-\\nable LLMs to access external information when\\n* Equal contributions.\\n† Corresponding author.\\nthey are confused during the reasoning process to\\nachieve more deliberative reasoning (Jiang et al.,\\n2024a).\\nTo address this issue, extensive research has fo-\\ncused on augmenting LLMs with external informa-\\ntion sources (i.e., RAG (Gao et al., 2024)). Early\\napproaches emphasize specific prompting strate-\\ngies to guide LLMs (Li et al., 2025; Teng et al.,\\n2025) and subsequent studies investigate to dis-\\ntill this capability into smaller LLMs through su-\\npervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Wang et al., 2025b).\\nHowever, recent findings suggest that SFT-based\\ndistillation can cause models to memorize solution\\npaths, limiting their generalization to novel scenar-\\nios (Chu et al., 2025). Further proposals include a\\ntest-time scaling method (Li et al., 2024), notably\\nemploying the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)\\nframework (Sun et al., 2025) to enhance solution-\\nfinding by expanding the search space during infer-\\nence, but this approach incurs significant inference\\noverhead, reducing its practicality for widespread\\nuse. Recent studies employ end-to-end outcome-\\nbased reinforcement learning (RL) to train models,\\nenabling them to autonomously explore external\\nretrieval environments during inference (Jin et al.,\\n2025; Song et al., 2025). This approach fosters the\\ndevelopment of self-directed retrieval capabilities\\nin LLMs as they reason. However, such models\\noften become overly reliant on external search en-\\ngines after training, neglecting the utilization of\\ntheir internal knowledge.\\nIn practice, when humans attempt to solve fac-\\ntual questions, they first recall their internal knowl-\\nedge, and only turn to search engines when they\\nrecognize a lack of information. At the same time,\\nafter obtaining the external searched information,\\nhumans would memorize this knowledge for future\\nuse. For LLMs, extensive pretraining on large-scale\\ndata has already endowed them with substantial\\ninternal knowledge (Qwen et al., 2025). There-\\nfore, it is essential to equip models with the ability\\narXiv:2505.17005v1  [cs.CL]  22 May 2025\\nto dynamically switch between internal and exter-\\nnal knowledge sources as needed. Furthermore,\\nmodels should be encouraged to effectively mem-\\norize useful information encountered during train-\\ning (Jiang et al., 2024b), progressively enriching\\ntheir internal knowledge and continuously evolving\\ntoward greater intelligence.\\nIn this paper, we present R1-Searcher++, a\\nnovel framework designed to teach LLMs to adap-\\ntively leverage both internal and external knowl-\\nedge. We adopt a two-stage training strategy: SFT\\nCold-start and RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisi-\\ntion. In the first phase, we employ reject sampling\\nto collect data that meets the format requirements\\nand perform a cold start with SFT. In the second\\nstage, we further train the model using outcome-\\nbased RL to guide the model in dynamically ac-\\nquiring knowledge, which is to encourage reliance\\non internal knowledge when confident, and invoke\\nexternal search mechanisms when uncertain, based\\non a carefully designed reward design. Addition-\\nally, we further introduce a memory mechanism,\\nenabling the model to retain knowledge encoun-\\ntered during training by converting and memorizing\\nretrieved content. This mechanism continuously\\nenriches its internal knowledge, empowering it to\\neffectively balance internal reasoning and exter-\\nnal retrieval through autonomous exploration and\\ntimely memorization.\\nTo verify the effectiveness of R1-Searcher++,\\nwe conduct extensive experiments based on Qwen-\\n2.5-7B-Instruct. Notably, our method surpasses\\nthe strong baseline by up to 4.3% and reduces the\\nretrieval count by 42.9% compared to vanilla RL-\\nbased approaches.\\nOur principal contributions are as follows:\\n• We introduce R1-Searcher++, teaching LLMs\\nto adaptively leverage both internal and external\\nknowledge through a two-stage training strategy.\\n•We encourage the model to actively leverage its\\ninternal knowledge while efficiently memorizing\\nexternal information, enabling dynamic knowledge\\nacquisition through exploration and memorization.\\n•\\nExtensive\\nexperiments\\nshow\\nthat\\nR1-\\nSearcher++ outperforms existing RAG methods,\\nwhile significantly reducing the number of re-\\ntrievals compared to vanilla RL-based approaches.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation. To improve\\nthe factual accuracy of LLM inference and reduce\\nhallucinations, researchers have proposed enhanc-\\ning language models by incorporating external in-\\nformation sources, a paradigm known as RAG (Fan\\net al., 2024). Early RAG approaches primarily\\ninclude Branching (Kim et al., 2024), Summariza-\\ntion (Li et al., 2023), and Adaptive Retrieval (Jeong\\net al., 2024) strategies. As foundation models have\\nbecome increasingly capable, exhibiting strong\\nCoT reasoning abilities, many studies have com-\\nbined RAG with CoT. These efforts include meth-\\nods that prompt the model to perform step-by-step\\nretrieval (Shao et al., 2023; Trivedi et al., 2023) and\\nstrategies that distill such capabilities into smaller\\nLLMs (Asai et al., 2024).\\nIn parallel, several\\nworks have explored test-time scaling, notably us-\\ning MCTS (Feng et al., 2025) to dynamically ex-\\npand reasoning paths. However, such approaches\\noften incur substantial inference-time overhead.\\nMore recently, researchers have trained models us-\\ning outcome- supervision RL (Zheng et al., 2025)\\nto encourage the exploration of more effective ac-\\ntions and retrieval behaviors, but it leads models to\\nover-rely on external search engines, diminishing\\ntheir ability to leverage internal knowledge (Wang\\net al., 2025a). Enabling LLMs to effectively inte-\\ngrate and alternate between internal knowledge and\\nexternal retrieval remains a significant challenge.\\nReinforcement Learning. To improve training ef-\\nficiency, several off-policy algorithms have since\\nbeen proposed (Rafailov et al., 2024; Ethayarajh\\net al., 2024); however, these methods still face\\nlimitations in terms of preference modeling ac-\\ncuracy and generalization capability (Pang et al.,\\n2024). DeepseekMath introduced the GRPO al-\\ngorithm (Shao et al., 2024), which enables effi-\\ncient self-exploration through a mechanism of rel-\\native preference optimization. Building on this,\\nDeepseek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) have\\ndemonstrated that outcome-based RL can signifi-\\ncantly enhance the reasoning abilities of large mod-\\nels. More recently, studies have begun to inves-\\ntigate RL algorithms specifically designed to im-\\nprove LLM reasoning capabilities (Yu et al.; Yuan\\net al., 2025). In parallel, other research efforts have\\napplied RL to the retrieval domain, aiming to en-\\nable deep search capabilities (Chen et al., 2025).\\nHowever, the use of RL that combine LLM-driven\\nretrieval and reasoning remains largely simplistic\\nand underexplored.\\n3\\nPreliminary\\nTo enhance the performance of LLMs in open-\\ndomain multi-hop question answering tasks (Ho\\net al., 2020), in this work, we focus on enabling the\\nmodel to autonomously decide when to use its in-\\nternal knowledge or to invoke an external retriever\\nto answer the given questions with the LLM self-\\nimproving paradigm, which can improve both rea-\\nsoning effectiveness and efficiency. To this end, we\\nintroduce three special tokens to format the LLM\\nreasoning process, i.e., <internal>, <external>,\\nand <document>. Concretely, during the reasoning\\nprocess, the LLM with parameters θ determines\\nwhether the current step requires external knowl-\\nedge to help perform reasoning. If so, it triggers\\nthe <external> to issue a queryt, which is sent to\\na retriever to retrieve the top-K relevant documents\\nDt = {dt,k}K\\nk=1 from an external corpus. These re-\\ntrieved documents are incorporated into the reason-\\ning path with another special token <document>.\\nOtherwise, the model directly generates the related\\ninternal knowledge enclosed in <internal>. After\\nseveral reasoning steps, the LLM obtains the final\\nanswer and stops the reasoning process.\\nSince our approach is orthogonal to the RL\\nalgorithm, we conduct the experiments based\\non a widely used RL algorithm, i.e., REIN-\\nFORCE++ (Hu, 2025), which is a stable RL algo-\\nrithm without the critic model. To better accommo-\\ndate the retrieval scenario, we mask the retrieved\\ndocuments during the loss calculation process, as\\nthey serve as environmental observations rather\\nthan model-generated content. Formally, for each\\nquestion q, we first samples a group of outputs\\n{o1, o2, · · · , oG} from the old policy model πθold.\\nNext, we incorporate the KL regularization into the\\nreward scores Rϕ(q, oi,≤t) , and then normalize the\\nadvantage scores:\\nˆA\\n′\\ni,t = R(q, oi) −β · PT\\ni=t KL(i), ˆAi,t =\\nˆ\\nA\\n′\\ni,t−mean( ˆA)\\nstd( ˆA)\\nWe utilize ˆA to denote the set of all advantages in\\nthe global batch that contains ˆAi,t. After obtaining\\nthe advantage scores, we set the mask value M(i, t)\\nas 0 if this token belongs to an external document,\\notherwise we set M(i, t) = 1. Finally, we em-\\nploy the masks M(i, t) in the objective function to\\nremove the influence of retrieved documents:\\nˆPi,t = min\\nh\\npi,t ˆAi,t, clip (pi,t, 1 −ε, 1 + ε) ˆAi,t\\ni\\n,\\nJMask(θ) = 1\\nG\\nPG\\ni=1\\n1\\nP|oi|\\nt=1 M(i,t)\\nP|oi|\\nt=1 M(i, t) · ˆPi,t\\n(1)\\nwhere ε is a hyper-parameter and p(i, t) is the im-\\nportant sampling coefficient , and πθ is the policy\\nmodel.\\n4\\nMethodology\\nIn this part, we introduce the R1-Searcher++\\nframework, which aims to teach LLM to adaptively\\nutilize internal and external knowedge through two\\ncritical stages, i.e., SFT Cold-Start (Section 4.1)\\nand RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition (Sec-\\ntion 4.2). Concretely, in the first stage, we utilize\\nthe curated data to perform SFT on the model, to\\nstandardize its responses in a specific format and\\nenable it to leverage external retrievers and inter-\\nnal knowledge adaptively. In the second stage, we\\nemploy RL on LLM that encourages the model\\nto explore more effective actions and behaviours,\\nand further incorporate the internal knowledge uti-\\nlization encouragement and external knowledge\\nmemorization in the training process, to guide the\\nmodel to dynamically acquire knowledge and con-\\ntinuously enrich its internal knowledge, which can\\nlead to higher reasoning efficiency.\\n4.1\\nSFT Cold-start\\nTo equip LLMs with the preliminary ability to au-\\ntonomously perform external retrieval during infer-\\nence while effectively leveraging internal knowl-\\nedge, we synthesize high-quality training instances\\nusing rejection sampling, without relying on other\\npowerful models.We only keep the correct re-\\nsponses with the appropriate occurrences of both\\nthe <internal> and <external> tags, teaching\\nLLM to perform dynamic knowledge acquisition\\nin a proper format.\\nSpecifically, given the question x and the syn-\\nthesized output y, once the i-th token of the output\\nbelongs to the external document, it will be masked,\\ni.e., Mi = 0.

Therefore, given the question q and the i-th\\ngenerated response oi, we design the format reward\\nand answer reward to induce the model to perform\\nreasoning correctly with the expected format, and\\nincorporate the group reward into the final reward\\nfunction to mitigate the over-reliance on the exter-\\nnal retriever. Now, we introduce the details of the\\nreward function in the following.\\nFormat reward. We impose a strict formatting\\nconstraint to ensure model responses are consistent\\nand clear. During the reasoning process, when call-\\ning the external retriever, the model is required\\nto formulate a query and enclose it within the\\n<external>...</external> tags, and is prohib-\\nited from generating document content directly\\nwithout first invoking retrieval. When the reasoning\\nprocess finishes, the final response must satisfy the\\nfollowing criteria, i.e., the final answer must be en-\\nclosed within boxed{}, and the content should not\\ncontain any garbled or unreadable content. Once\\nthe model behaviours satisfy the above require-\\nments, we set the format reward Rformat as 0, while\\nwe set the reward as −2 if any requirement fails, as\\nshown in the following,\\nRformat(q, oi) =\\n(\\n0,\\nThe format of oi is correct\\n-2,\\nThe format of oi is incorrect\\n(3)\\nAnswer reward. To indicate the correctness of\\nthe final answer, we leverage the Cover Exact\\nMatch (CEM) metric to calculate the answer re-\\nward, adapting to the group reward discussed in\\nthe following and relieving the issue of EM being\\ntoo strict. Concretely, CEM is True if the ground\\ntruth answer appears in the predicted answer ai\\nextracted from the response oi, and False for other\\nsituations. However, we observe that LLM can eas-\\nily hack the CEM metric during the RL process,\\nwhere LLM is likely to generate a longer predicted\\nanswer that will receive a higher probability to\\ncover the ground truth answer, causing the CEM to\\nbe falsely high. Therefore, we regard the answer\\nexceeding 10 words as an incorrect answer, requir-\\ning LLM to generate the answer within ten words,\\nwhich can alleviate the above reward hacking is-\\nsue. In summary, the answer reward Ranswer can be\\ncomputed as follows,\\nRanswer(q, oi) =\\n(\\n1,\\nai within 10 words ∧CEM=True\\n0,\\nOtherwise\\n(4)\\nGroup reward. Building upon the first two re-\\nwards for LLM reasoning effectiveness, the group\\nreward is designed to encourage the model to re-\\nduce its reliance on external retrieval, increasing\\nthe reasoning efficiency. Considering that the vari-\\nance of the external retriever calling times by LLM\\nreflects the necessity of performing external re-\\ntrieval, group reward is calculated by the standard\\ndeviation of the number of calls to the retriever\\nin correct responses to the same question. For-\\nmally, given the question q and a set of generated\\nresponses {o1, o2, . . . , on}, we first count the num-\\nber of calls to the retriever ti of each response,\\nand then calculate the standard deviation σ of\\n{t1, t2, . . . , tn}. Next, we calculate the minimum\\nnumber of calls to the retriever of the correct re-\\nsponses, i.e., tmin = min{ti | Ranswer(q, oi) = 1}.\\nR\\n′\\ngroup(q, oi) =\\n(\\n2 × σ2,\\nRanswer(q, oi) = 1 ∧ti = tmin\\n0,\\nOtherwise\\n(5)\\nMeanwhile, to maintain training stability and pre-\\nvent excessive variance, we introduce a hyperpa-\\nrameter η to clip the corresponding factor. The final\\ncomputation of reward is formulated as follows,\\nRgroup(q, oi) = min\\n\\x10\\nR\\n′\\ngroup(q, oi), η\\n\\x11\\n(6)\\nFinally, the reward R(q, oi) utilized to calculate\\nthe advantage in Equation 7 is defined as the sum\\nof the three sub-rewards mentioned above:\\nR(q, oi) = Rformat(q, oi) + Ranswer(q, oi) + Rgroup(q, oi)\\n(7)\\n4.2.2\\nExternal Knowledge Memorization\\nThe standard RL training paradigm relies on the\\nmodel’s self-exploration and the feedback from the\\nexternal environment. In retrieval-based scenarios,\\nsince the knowledge retrieved by the retriever is en-\\ntirely correct, the model should like a human, aim\\nto memorize this information during training, trans-\\nforming it into internal knowledge. This enables\\nthe model to utilize the acquired knowledge di-\\nrectly in future instances without repeated retrieval,\\nthereby achieving efficient reuse of retrieved infor-\\nmation. Thus, we incorporate external knowledge\\nmemorization by rewriting the retrieved informa-\\ntion to align with the model’s interanl knowledge\\nutilization pattern, enabling the model to internal-\\nize them effectively.\\nTo obtain the rewritten instances, at the begin-\\nning of the RL process, we fine-tune a separate\\nmodel on the data filtered in Section 4.1 as the\\nrewritting model, which can solve the questions\\nbased on the pre-processed documents that do not\\ncall the retriever. During the RL process, we select\\nthe correct responses generated by LLM, and then\\nextract the retrieved documents from the responses.\\nGiven the question and the extracted documents\\nin the context, the rewriting model can generate\\nthe reasoning paths without calling the external re-\\ntriever. After validating the correctness of these\\nreasoning paths, we select the correct instances to\\nconstruct the dataset T for memorization and inter-\\nnalization. In conclusion, the corresponding loss\\nfor memorization is computed as follows:\\nLM(θ) =\\n−1\\nP\\noi∈T |oi|\\nX\\noi∈T\\n|oi|\\nX\\nt=1\\nlog πθ(oi,t|q, oi,<t)\\n(8)\\nTo avoid the LM(θ) from dominating the policy\\nmodel’s training and causing the model to ignore\\nexternal retrieval, we weight it with a pre-defined\\ncoefficient µ. The final loss used to optimize the\\npolicy model during the retrieval scenario RL pro-\\ncess is computed as follows:\\nL(θ) = −JMask(θ) + µ ∗LM(θ)\\n(9)\\nThus, during training, the model not only en-\\ngages in self-exploration but also continuously en-\\nriches its internal knowledge, enabling it to become\\nincreasingly smarter over time.\\n5\\nExperiments\\n5.1\\nExperimental Settings\\nDatasets and Evaluation Metrics. We evaluate\\nusing four multi-hop datasets: HotpotQA (Yang\\net al., 2018), 2WikiMultiHopQA (Ho et al.,\\n2020), Musique (Trivedi et al., 2022), and Bam-\\nboogle (Press et al., 2023). HotpotQA and 2Wiki-\\nMultiHopQA are in-domain benchmarks since\\nparts of their training sets are used for training.\\nIn contrast, Musique and Bamboogle serve as out-\\nof-domain benchmarks to assess our model’s gener-\\nalization capabilities. We randomly select 500 sam-\\nples from the entire validation sets of HotpotQA,\\n2WikiMultiHopQA, and Musique, and use the en-\\ntire test set of Bamboogle to form our final test\\nset. For evaluation metrics, we utilize F1-score\\nand LLM-as-Judge (LasJ). considering that the an-\\nswers to open-ended multi-hop questions are not\\nuniform in form. The F1-score measures the word-\\nlevel similarity between the predicted answer and\\nthe reference answer while LLM-as-Judge employs\\nGPT-4o-mini to assess the correctness of predic-\\ntion. The evaluation prompt for LasJ is provided in\\nAppendix B.\\nBaselines. We compare R1-Searcher++ against\\nseveral baselines. Naive Generation generates an-\\nswers directly without retrieval. Standard RAG rep-\\nresents traditional RAG systems that retrieve docu-\\nments directly based on the question. SuRe (Kim\\net al., 2024) executes multiple reasoning paths in\\nparallel for a single query. Selective-Context (Li\\net al., 2023) compresses retrieved documents to\\nreduce context length. Adaptive-RAG (Jeong et al.,\\n2024) dynamically selects retrieval strategies de-\\npending on the complexity of the query.\\nCR-\\nPlanner (Li et al., 2024) scales RAG at inference\\ntime using MCTS. RAG-CoT methods, such as\\nIter-RetGen (Trivedi et al., 2023), IRCoT (Shao\\net al., 2023), and Search-o1 (Li et al., 2025), which\\ncombine RAG with CoT using prompts. RAG-RL\\nmethods like R1-Searcher (Song et al., 2025) and\\nSearch-R1 (Jin et al., 2025) leverage RL to enable\\nthe model to learn to autonomously perform re-\\ntrieval during inference.\\nImplementation Details R1-Searcher++ and all\\nbaseline models are either trained or prompted us-\\ning the Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct as the backbone, and\\nevaluated with FlashRAG (Jin et al., 2024) using\\nlocal dense retrieval corpus. The retrieval corpus\\ncomprises the English Wikipedia as provided by\\nKILT (Petroni et al., 2021) in 2019, segmented into\\n100-word passages with appended titles, totaling 29\\nmillion passages. We employ BGE-large-en-v1.5\\nas the text retriever. Detailed training settings for\\nR1-Searcher++ are provided in Appendix A.\\n5.2\\nMain Results\\nTable1 shows the results of R1-Searcher++ and the\\nbaselines on four mutil-step benchmarks. We can\\nobtain the following observations:\\n• Achieving Significant Performance Improve-\\nment on Multi-Hop QA. Our method,\\nR1-\\nSearcher++, achieves significant performance im-\\nprovements over all mutil-hop QA benchmarks\\nunder the LLM-as-Judge evaluation metric, in-\\ncluding both tree search-based and RL-based ap-\\nproaches.\\nSpecifically, R1-Searcher++ outper-\\nforms CR-Planner by 25.7% and surpasses the\\nbest vanilla RL-based method R1-Searcher by 4.3%\\non the overall test set. These results demonstrate\\nthat our approach effectively enables the model to\\nperform accurate and timely retrieval invocations\\nthroughout the reasoning process, thereby enhanc-\\ning overall performance.\\n• Balancing the Utilization of Internal and Ex-\\nternal Knowledge. While maintaining strong per-\\nformance on the evaluation datasets, our method\\nachieves a significant reduction in retrieval count\\ncompared to vanilla RL-based RAG approaches.\\nSpecifically, the average retrieval count is reduced\\nby 30.0% and 52.9% compared to R1-Searcher and\\nSearch-R1, respectively. This observation suggests\\na potential conflict between external information\\nand the internal knowledge of LLMs and one pos-\\nsible reason is that directly injecting retrieved doc-\\numents into the reasoning process may introduce\\nnoise. This demonstrates that the model should\\nlearn to make full use of its internal knowledge and\\nonly invoke the retriever when necessary.\\n• Maintaining Generalization Ability. Despite\\nbeing trained on only 9000 samples, the model\\nachieves strong performance on in-domain datasets\\nand further exhibits impressive generalization to\\nout-of-domain datasets.\\nThis suggests that the\\nmodel effectively learns to retrieve relevant doc-\\numents and leverage internal knowledge, integrat-\\ning both with reasoning through exploration during\\ntraining. This enables robust performance on new\\ntest datasets that require retrieval. Furthermore, it\\ncan also seamlessly generalizes to online search, as\\ndetailed in Section 6.2.\\n6\\nFurther Analysis\\n6.1\\nAblation Study\\nTo validate the effectiveness of our proposed R1-\\nSearcher++ framework, we conduct a comprehen-\\nsive ablation analysis of its key design elements.\\nWe design five distinct variants: (1) w/o Stage-1\\nremoves the initial SFT cold start stage; (2) w/o\\nStage-2 removes the entire RL training stage; (3)\\nw/o Rgroup removes the group reward in the RL\\nstage; (4) w/o LM removes the external knowledge\\nmemorization mechanism in the RL stage and (5)\\nw/o Rgroup and LM removes both the group reward\\nand the external knowledge memorization mech-\\nanism. The performance of these variants is pre-\\nsented in Table 2. As observed, all ablated variants\\nexhibit a decline in performance compared to our\\nfull method, underscoring the integral contribution\\nof each component. Specifically, w/o Stage-1 leads\\nto a degradation in performance along with an in-\\ncrease in retrieval count. Meanwhile, the perfor-\\nmance of w/o Stage-2 drops significantly, primarily\\nbecause simple SFT causes the model to over-rely\\non its internal knowledge. This highlights the ne-\\ncessity of our two-stage pipeline. Futhermore, dur-\\ning RL training, w/o Rgroup during RL also leads\\nto a reduction in performance.

Moreover, it\\nachieves the highest accuracy, indicating the effec-\\ntive utilization of internal knowledge.\\nFurthermore, Figure 3 shows the changes in re-\\ntrieval count and reward during the process of RL\\ntraining for R1-Searcher and R1-Searcher++. For\\nour method, We observe that the reward increases\\nsteadily and eventually plateaus, while the retrieval\\ncount initially shows a slight decline, followed by\\na continuous rise, and ultimately stabilizes. This\\ntrend can be attributed to the influence of SFT in\\nthe Stage-1, during which the model exhibits a low\\ndemand for invoking the search engine. As train-\\ning progresses, the model gradually discovers that\\nperforming external searches can yield higher re-\\nwards, leading to an increase in retrieval behavior.\\nIn the later phase, a balance is gradually established\\nbetween the use of external search and internal\\nknowledge, resulting in the stabilization of both re-\\ntrieval count and reward. In contrast, R1-Searcher\\nexhibits significantly higher retrieval counts while\\nits reward quickly stabilizes, indicating an over-\\nreliance on the retriever. This effectively validates\\nthe effectiveness of our approach in achieving a\\nbalanced utilization of internal and external knowl-\\nedge, while gradually enabling dynamic knowledge\\nacquisition throughout the RL training process.\\n6.4\\nCase Study\\nTo illustrate the overall reasoning process of R1-\\nSearcher++, we analyze a representative example\\nfrom the Bamboogle dataset. Figure 2 compares\\nthe responses generated by R1-Searcher++, Search-\\nR1, and the untrained model when presented with\\nthe same question.\\nThe vanilla Qwen-2.5-7B-\\nInstruct, without invoking any external search en-\\ngine, relies solely on its internal knowledge and\\nproduces an incorrect answer. In contrast, while\\nSearch-R1 arrives at the correct answer (i.e., James\\nMadison), it issues an excessive number of queries,\\nincluding unnecessary one, thereby underutilizing\\nits internal knowledge and incurring significant\\ntime overhead. Our R1-Searcher++ demonstrates\\nthe ability to break down the complex question and\\ndynamically adjust its behavior based on the nature\\nof the sub-question. For instance, when encounter-\\ning an uncertain or ambiguous sub-question (i.e.,\\nWhen was Citibank founded?), it opts to perform\\nan external search. However, when faced with a\\nmore specific question that can be answered using\\ninternal knowledge (i.e., Who was the president\\nof the United States in 1812?), it leverages its in-\\nternal knowledge directly without invoking search.\\nThis flexible mechanism enables a balance bewteen\\nthe external search and internal knowledge. More\\ncases are provided in Appendix C.\\n7\\nConclusion\\nIn this paper, we introduced R1-Searcher++, a\\nnovel framework that enables large language mod-\\nels to dynamically integrate and alternate between\\ninternal knowledge and external retrieval. This is\\na two-stage training strategy consisting of an SFT\\nCold-start phase and RL for Dynamic Knowledge\\nAcquisition. The RL stage incorporates a reward\\nmechanism to encourage internal knowledge uti-\\nlization, and a memory module to convert retrieved\\ninformation into internal knowledge. Through this\\ndesign, R1-Searcher++ empowers LLMs to per-\\nform efficient retrieval-augmented reasoning while\\ncontinuously enriching their internal knowledge via\\nself-exploration and memory. Experimental results\\non multi-hop tasks demonstrate that R1-Searcher++\\noutperforms existing RAG methods.\\nLimitation\\nDespite our significant efforts, this work has two\\nlimitations due to computational resources and\\nfunding constraints. First, we only incorporated\\na real-world search engine during the evaluation\\nphase to assess the generalization ability of our\\nmethod, while relying on a local denseretrieval\\ncorpus during training. Aligning the training pro-\\ncess with real-world conditions by integrating a\\nreal search engine may lead to improved perfor-\\nmance through more realistic supervision. Addi-\\ntionally, our current experiments are limited to a\\n7B-parameter model. In future work, we plan to\\ntrain and evaluate our framework on larger-scale\\nmodels to further validate its generalization capa-\\nbility and robustness.\\nReferences\\nAkari Asai, Zeqiu Wu, Yizhong Wang, Avirup Sil, and\\nHannaneh Hajishirzi. 2024.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps by injecting\\nexternal information, but current methods often are costly, generalize poorly,\\nor ignore the internal knowledge of the model. In this paper, we introduce\\nR1-Searcher++, a novel framework designed to train LLMs to adaptively leverage\\nboth internal and external knowledge sources. R1-Searcher++ employs a two-stage\\ntraining strategy: an initial SFT Cold-start phase for preliminary format\\nlearning, followed by RL for Dynamic Knowledge Acquisition. The RL stage uses\\noutcome-supervision to encourage exploration, incorporates a reward mechanism\\nfor internal knowledge utilization, and integrates a memorization mechanism to\\ncontinuously assimilate retrieved information, thereby enriching the model's\\ninternal knowledge. By leveraging internal knowledge and external search\\nengine, the model continuously improves its capabilities, enabling efficient\\nretrieval-augmented reasoning. Our experiments demonstrate that R1-Searcher++\\noutperforms previous RAG and reasoning methods and achieves efficient\\nretrieval.
